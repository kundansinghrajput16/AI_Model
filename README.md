## 🧠 AI Model: Plant Disease Detection

At the heart of Dhruv.AI is an **AI model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** trained to detect plant diseases from aerial images captured by drones.

### 🎯 Core Functions:

- **Image Processing**: High-resolution frames from drone footage are extracted and analyzed.
- **CNN-Based Detection**: The AI model identifies symptoms of diseases such as leaf spots, mildew, or nutrient deficiencies with high accuracy (~92%).
- **Heatmap Generation**: Affected regions are visualized on a geospatial heatmap for easy reference.
- **Diagnosis & Recommendation**: Based on detection, the system recommends targeted pesticide spraying.

### 🛠 Technical Details:

- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow / PyTorch
- **Language**: Python
- **Accuracy**: ~92% on test datasets
- **Input**: Drone video/image feed(live)
- **Output**: Detected disease labels, bounding boxes, severity index, and heatmap
